How many cases have been confirmed since the pandemic started? How is the number of cases changing?\n2. Deaths: How many deaths from COVID-19 have been reported? Is the number of deaths rising or falling? How does the death rate compare to other countries?\n3. Vaccinations: How many vaccine doses are being administered each day? How many doses have been administered in total? What share of the population has been vaccinated?\n4. Death rates per million population ( for a specific period â€“ peak pandemic and off-peak time)\n5. GDP\n\n\n## Audience \n\n1. Hospital Personnel\n2. Government \n3.
